# Public Transport Simulation

This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course at the University of Warsaw. It simulates the behavior of trams and passengers, aiming to demonstrate the application of fundamental object-oriented programming concepts and the implementation of basic data structures in Java.

## Features
- **Custom Data Structures**: Implementation of custom Vector, Queue, and Priority Queue data structures.
- **Statistics**: Collection and display of various statistics at the end of the simulation.
- **User-Defined Routes**: Users can create their own set of stops and routes.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to include additional means of transport and event types.
- **OOP Principles**: Adheres to core object-oriented programming principles, resulting in a robust and scalable codebase.

## Usage

The project can be compiled and run using JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.
