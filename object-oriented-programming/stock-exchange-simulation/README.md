# Stock Exchange Simulation

This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course at the University of Warsaw. It simulates the behavior of investors in a simplified stock exchange environment. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of fundamental object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Features
- **Investor Behavior Simulation**: Models two types of investors: Random Investor and SMA Investor, with distinct strategies and behaviors. 
- **Market Mechanisms**: Simulates basic market mechanisms, including buying and selling of stocks.
- **Order Types**: There are four different order types: Fill Or Kill Order, Good Till Cancelled Order, Good Till Date Order, Immediate Order.
- **OOP Principles**: Utilizes core object-oriented programming principles to create a robust and scalable codebase.

## Usage
Project can be compiled and run using JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.
