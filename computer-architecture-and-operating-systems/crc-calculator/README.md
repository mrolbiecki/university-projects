# CRC Checksum Calculator

## Description
This project implements a program `crc` written in assembly, which calculates the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Code) checksum of data contained in a sparse file. The program processes file data in segments, calculating the checksum byte by byte, using a user-provided CRC polynomial.

## Usage
```bash
./crc file crc_poly
